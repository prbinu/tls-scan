TLS-SCAN INSTALLATION
---------------------

 This document describes installation on Linux and Mac OS/X (Darwin)
 operating systems.

Pre-requisites
--------------

 To build and install 'tls-scan', you will need:

  autoconf
  automake
  libtool
  pkg-config
  gcc
  git

 Build (direct) dependencies:

  libevent 2x
  openssl 1.0.2
  gnutls

 The above dependent packages also pulls few other packages as well.
 To reduce the complexy of building dependent pckages, we have created
 a script 'bootstrap.sh'. This script download and build all tls-scan
 dependent packages and finally executes 'autoreconf'.

Build and install from source
-----------------------------

 On Linux and Mac OS/X:

  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

 The 'build-x86-64.sh' is a utility script that wraps the above commands.


Installation from binary
------------------------

 Steps:
  1. Download the latest tarball:
     https://github.com/prbinu/tls-scan/releases/latest
  2. Un-tar the file creates a tls-scan directory locally that contains
     tls-scan binary, ca-bundle.crt and the man page


Source distribution
-------------------

 The following command will create a source distribution.

  $ make dist

 Note: While building from a source tarball, make sure ./bootstrap.sh 
 is executed prior to ./configure.
